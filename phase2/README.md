## Phase 2: Interaction Design

## Map

Whether something has occurred to you or you just wanted to check in on your friend after a night around town, we gave the users a way to know where their friend/family is located so that coming to their aid would require less effort if one needed help. 

## Group

We were motivated by Mark’s scenario in which we wanted to make sure his friends were safe. We wanted a quick access between different groups of friends, whether temporary or permanent, that would make tracking your friends more efficient and safe.

## Notification

## Safehaven

With most people in our survey stating they do not feel safe traveling alone, we thought it was a good idea to allow users to add their “Safe Havens”. Places that are considered safe to the user so that your friends can know when you have reached your destination.

## More

## Emergency

We set an emergency button in the quick toolbar in the middle for fast access and set a single place to send a distress call to all your group members. This is because in Jenny’s scenario when feeling unsafe, we would want to be able to notify friends and family as quickly as possible. The survey showed that a lot of people seemed to walk unaccompanied.
